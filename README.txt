After making a website for an internship I took out all the company details and created a template for a website.
submit.php needs an email account.  A google catcha api is used for email security.


This is a simple template that includes HTML, CSS, and JS to make it all work along with PHP for the email service.
Index is the main page providing a graphical background and navigation for all over the web page.  The other pages were given generic names
and filler text to give the representation of the finished product.

Feel free to use this as an example or as a template for a website you plan on building.
